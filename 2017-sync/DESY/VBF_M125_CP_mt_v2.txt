Sample : /VBFHToTauTauUncorrelatedDecay_Filtered_M125_TuneCP5_13TeV-powheg-pythia8/RunIIFall17MiniAODv2-PU2017_12Apr2018_94X_mc2017_realistic_v14-v1/MINIAODSIM

* applied corrections
  - tau ES shift as proposed by TauPOG
  - recoil corrections to puppi MET
  - IP and IP significance corrections
  - JER smearing using hybrid method (determenistic 
    seeding is used for stochastic smearing)

* !!!! Tau is selected if MVA DM > -1 !!!!

* New tau ID SF binned in MVA decay mode (from IC)
* New tau trigger SF binned in MVA decay mode (from IC)

* fastMTT is run and m_fast is saved in ntuple

* added new variables
  - ipx_1, ipy_1, ipz_1 - muon IP coordinates
  - ipx_2, ipy_2, ipz_2 - pion IP coordinates
  - ipsig_1 - IP significance of muon
  - ipsig_2 - IP significance of pion
  - acotautau_00 - phi(CP) IP-IP method
  - acotautau_01 - phi(CP) IP-DP method (set to -9999 if tauDM==0)

* trigger event weight is computed according to the formula
    weight = eff(data)/eff(MC) with
    eff = eff(L) + (eff(l)-eff(L))*eff(tau),
    where
     o eff(L) - efficiency of the single muon trigger
     o eff(l) - efficiency of lepton leg (mu) of the cross-trigger
     o eff(tau) - efficiency of tau leg of the cross-trigger 
  and saved in variable "trigweight"
  
* event is selected by requiring the OR of the 
  single muon and mu+tau trigger paths matching with 
  HLT objects within dR < 0.5
